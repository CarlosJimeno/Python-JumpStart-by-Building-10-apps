# Python Jumpstart Course 

This is my own version of the projects developed on the 'Python Jumpstart by Building 10 apps' course by [talkpython](https://training.talkpython.fm/)

The programs are all very similar to the original ones since I made them while watching the course.

## Course and original repository

[Course](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/python-language-jumpstart-building-10-apps)

Michael Kennedy (course teacher) [original repository](https://github.com/mikeckennedy/python-jumpstart-course-demos)

See his README for more info about the course.

I recommend the course if you are new to Python, you'll learn all the basics and more while having fun at the same time. Michael Kennedy gives very clear explanations on every topic + the course-video-tool has really nice features like changing the speed and seeing the English transcriptions on top of the video (which is great if English is not your native language).
